Lithodomous.net is my personal website, and my gateway to learning github and improving my code skills.

It's quite a mess, but it's my mess and a project I've wanted to work on since forever. (What internet-loving kid didn't want their own website!?)

I hope that as I grow as a computer-wizz so will my website, so stay tuned! :D
